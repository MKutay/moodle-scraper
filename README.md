IT DOES NOT WORK AT THE MOMENT (maybe later i will work on it)

Update: 
The one that stole our mail, I will find you. Don't steel again.
We created a new mail and I am not going to put it in github.

It Works!!! Thanks to the magical line.

It can login to the site and check that if there is any homework.
And It can send mail.

If you never entered login information it will ask for it and it will rembember it.

if you do 
```
python3 main.py --login
```
It will forcefully get login information.

```
python3 main.py --sendAll
```
It will send all homeworks and open a html file with all of the homeworks.

```
python3 main.py --check
```
This code will check if there is new homeworks.

# os
MacOS
maybe linux
